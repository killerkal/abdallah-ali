<h1><strong>My Pet</strong></h1>
<h2>Definition of a pet</h2>
<p>The term “pet” means a domesticated animal, such as a dog, cat, bird, rodent, fish, turtle, or other animal that is kept for pleasure rather than for commercial purposes.</p>
<h2>my dog brownie</h2>
<p><break>Brownie is the name of my pet dog. He has long, drooping ears with a mix of white, black and brown fur on his body</break>.<break>He is of Beagle breed. We adopted him from a dog care centre in our neighbourhood when he was just a month old</break>.<em>He has a cute face with little paws and eyes and has a tiny tail. He is a healthy dog with a shiny coat</em>.

  Brownie runs very fast with his four tiny legs. He watches our house at night. In case of any noise, he barks out loudly. Although he barks at strangers, he never bites them. He loves eating vegetables and I sometimes offer him meat and fish to eat. I bathe him once every few days and play with him in the garden to ensure he is exposed to sunlight and fresh air every day.
  
 my be My pet, Brownie is close to me and I love him very much. He cheers me up whenever I’m upset and we go for a walk every morning. He wags his tail with joy when I return from school. I take him to the veterinary doctor occasionally for vaccination. He is not just my pet dog, but st friend too.<break> He is indeed a blessing in my life.</break>
